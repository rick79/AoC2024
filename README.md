# Advent of Code 2024
Trying to learn Julia this year.
## Day 1: Historian Hysteria
Learned about broadcasting and working with arrays in Julia. 

## Day 2: Red-Nosed Reports
Learned about constructing arrays comprehensiouns ([x for x in y]). I foresee that my code will be less readable from now on. 

## Day 3: Mull It Over
Learned how to use regex in Julia and how to work with matrices.

## Day 4: Ceres Search
Learned about the shorthand condition && dothisiftrue. My code will from now on be even less readable. 

## Day 5: Print Queue
Learned about anonymous functions as arguments. 

## Day 6: Guard Gallivant
Learned about using tuples and unpacking tuples returned from functions. Also learned that sometimes sets are much more efficient (went from ~ 18 s to ~ 0.5 s for part to by just switching an array to a set).

## Day 7: Bridge Repair
Learned about using recursive functions, first class functions and the splat (`...`) operator. 

## Day 8: Resonant Collinearity
Learned about unpacking tuples in anonymous functions.

## Day 9: Disk Fragmenter
Learned to not rely too much on recursion instead iterating through arrays and about how to benchmark and time function calls.

## Day 10: Hoof It
Learned that the ∉ operator can be costly.

## Day 11: Plutonian Pebbles
Learned to RTFM ;)

## Day 12: Garden Groups
Learned how to use BenchmarkTools, and when refactoring my code how to work with CartesianIndex instead of tuples.

## Day 13: Claw Contraption
Learned how to use structs and mutable structs. Alsp found an interesting behaviour for matrix division where `A\b´ surprisingly didn't work that well since there seemed to be a very small error when doing this calculation for one of the machines in the test data.

## Day 14: Restroom Redoubt
Learned about file IO.

## Day 15: Warehouse Woes
Todays problems should be called the Adventures of Lolo! Didn't learn anything new =/

## Day 16: Reindeer Maze
Got to implement Dijkstras algorithm

## Day 17: Chronospatial Computer
Fun problems, but didn't learn anything new.

## Day 18: RAM Run
Didn't learn anything new =\


## Day 19: Linen Layout
Didn't learn anything new =(

 ## Day 20: Race Condition
Found something weird, if I used CartesianIndex in a vector comprehension the runtime went up from 120 ms to to about 2 s.

 ## Day 21:
Really fun problem, but didn't learn anything new =[

 ## Day 22:
Didn't learn anything new today either ={

 ## Day 23:
 Learned about the Momoization library (and didn't use it because of the overhead)

 ## Day 24:
 Learned to never give up ;)

 ## Day 25:
 Didn't learn anything new =|
